Influenza Division of the CDC provides FluView (weekly influenza surveillance report) and FluView Interactive which updates data every weekly

- Data is preliminary and may change
- One of goals is to measure impact of influenza to hospitalizations, outpatient ilness, and deaths
- Reasons to do this is b/c influenza viruses change, inform public health response, update vaccines, see antiviral resistance

- Data comes from various data sources to create surveillance system across 5 major categories:

    - Influenza Surveillance:  Approx 100 public health and over 300 clinical labs in all 50 States, PR, Guam, and D.C. participate in virologic surveillance for influenza. 
     This is done either through the U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System or the National Respiratory
     and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS).  Clinical Lab and Public Health results vary since Clinical lab test respiratory specimens for diagnostic purposes which can be used
     to help understand the timing and intensity of influenza activity.  Public Health labs test specimens to understand what virus types, subtypes, and lineages are circulating. 
     Both public health and clinical labs report each week to the CDC the total specimens tested and the number positve.
     - Virus Characterization: Coming from state and local public health labs. Testing to understand the specimens of influenza to compare how similar the current circulating influenza virusses are to prior ones and see evolutionary trajectory.
     It is also tested to see the effectiveness of antivirals. 

     - Outpatient Illness: Via the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) which consists of outpatient healthcare providers across the U.S.
     Around 2,600 outpatient healthcare providers provide data to the CDC regarding how many patients were seen and, of those patients, how many had influenza-like illness. Symptoms consits of a fever (temp of 100oF or higher) and a cough and/or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza.
     There is wide variability in regional level data, which is why they break up data by 10 regions. Highest is in Region 6 (Ark, Louis, NM, OK, Tx). Lowest is in Region 10 (AK, ID, Or, WA)
     ILINet also provides an activity indicator map which compares % of outpatient visits due to ILI relative to baselines when there is little to no virus circulation.

     - Geographic Spread: State and territorial Health Departments estimate the level of spread of influenza geographically in their respective jurisdictions via the "State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report."  They classify jursidictions across 5 cateogories from No Activity to Widespread. 

     - Hospitalizations Surveillance: The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) does population-based surveillance for lab-confirmed hospitalizations linked to influenza.  Hospital lab and admission databases as well as infection control logs for patients with a positive inluenza test are used to identify cases. 
     This is used to estimate hospitalization rates on a weekly basis by age. This netowrk contains 70 counties. Things looked at on patient charts are: Asthma, Blood disorder, Cariovascular disease, Chronic lung disease, chronic metabolic disease, liver disease, etc. (rest of list on website)
     "The rates provided are likely to be an underestimate as influenza-related hospitalizations can be missed if testing is not performed."

     - Mortality Surveillance: The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) gets death certificate data from state vital statistics officies for all deaths ocurring in the U.S. 
     "Pneumonia and Influenza deaths are identified based on ICD-10 multiple cause of death codes".    The surveillance data is aggregated by the week of death occurence.  NCHS surveillance data is released one week after the week of death to produce a more stable P&I percentage.  
     The primary use of this data is to report on the P&I percentage of appearance of these as a cause of death of all deaths.  
     A P&I seasonal percentage baseline is provided using a "periodic regression model [...] from the previous five years." An increase of 1.645 std deviations above the seasonal baseline is labeled as the , "epidemic threshold."  
     State data is classified by the city of residence of the deceased.
     - Pediatric Mortality Surveillance: People aged younger than 18 who have died of influenza was added as a nationally notifiable condition in 2004.  Labratory diagnostic tests are performed to identify if a child has died while having influenza, (and not recovered from it).  This data is passed to the CDC

- Notes on the Data
    - Reporting from partners is voluntary
    - Reason for data is to determine change in influenza activity, but not report on actual numbers of influenza illnesses.
    - Surveillance weeks start on Sundays and end on the following Saturday. Surveillance participants are asked to summarize their weekly data and submit it to the CDC by Tuesday afternoon of the following week. CDC updates their data sources every Friday.
    - Flu Seasons begin on Week 40 and end on Week 39 of the following year
    - Most flu seasons start around Oct and peak between Dec-Feb and remain elevated to May

"Data needed to estimate influenza-associated deaths may lag for up to two years after the season ends."
"It has been recognized for many years that influenza is underreported on death certificates."
"Only counting deaths where influenza was recorded on a death certificate would be a gross underestimation of influenza’s true impact."


"How CDC estimates Influenza-Associated Deaths in the U.S.
What methods are used to estimate the number of influenza-associated deaths in the U.S.?
The methods to estimate the annual number of influenza-associated deaths  have been described in detail elsewhere (1-2). The model uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total influenza-associated deaths from the estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizations.

We first look at how many in-hospital deaths were observed in FluSurv-NET. The in-hospital deaths are adjusted for under-detection of influenza using methods similar to those described above for hospitalizations using data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing. Second, because not all deaths related to influenza occur in the hospital, we use death certificate data to estimate how likely  deaths are to occur outside the hospital.  We look at death certificates that have pneumonia or influenza causes (P&I), other respiratory and circulatory causes (R&C), or other non-respiratory, non-circulatory causes of death, because deaths related to influenza may not have influenza listed as a cause of death. We use information on the causes of death from FluSurv-NET to determine the mixture of P&I, R&C, and other coded deaths to include in our investigation of death certificate data. Finally, once we estimate the proportion of influenza-associated deaths that occurred outside of the hospital, we can estimate the deaths-to-hospitalization ratio.

Data needed to estimate influenza-associated deaths may lag for up to two years after the season ends. When this is not yet available for the season being estimated, we adjust based on values observed in prior seasons (e.g., the 2010-2011 season through the 2016-2017 season) and update the estimates when more current data become available.

Why doesn’t CDC base its seasonal flu mortality estimates only on death certificates that specifically list influenza?
Seasonal influenza may lead to death from other causes, such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has been recognized for many years that influenza is underreported on death certificates. There may be several reasons for underreporting, including that patients aren’t always tested for seasonal influenza virus infection, particularly older adults who are at greatest risk of seasonal influenza complications and death. Even if a patient is tested for influenza, influenza virus infection may not be identified because the influenza virus is only detectable for a limited number of days  after infection and many people don’t seek medical care in this interval. Additionally, some deaths – particularly among those 65 years and older – are associated with secondary complications of influenza (including bacterial pneumonias). For these and other reasons, modeling strategies are commonly used to estimate flu-associated deaths. Only counting deaths where influenza was recorded on a death certificate would be a gross underestimation of influenza’s true impact.
