# United States Mortality Investigation
As of April 6, 2020, the United States has 41 states with Statewide orders to stay at home to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 [source](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html). This was done in the context of the growing threat of COVID-19 and related death estimates in the hundreds-of-thousands [source](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/29/us/politics/ap-us-virus-outbreak-washington.html?searchResultPosition=3).  The following work seeks to look at how the worldwide pandemic and drastic changes to daily lives may have impacted overall United States mortality at both the national and state levels.  



## Goals
<ol>
<li>Is overall United States mortality showing different behavior relative to prior years?</li>
<li>Is there any relationship between COVID-19 cases and overall mortality seen in U.S. States?</li>
<li>How can prior flu-season data frame the current projections of COVID-19's impact relative to overall mortality?</li>
</ol>
