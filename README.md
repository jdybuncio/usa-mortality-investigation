## Using overall United States Mortality to better understand the daily COVID-19 reports
COVID-19 has changed our day-to-day lives significantly and the fall-out effects will be studied for years to come. As of April 6th, 2020, the United States has 41 out of its 50 states with Statewide orders to stay at home  [source](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html). Additionally, this virus has changed our daily consumption and understanding of death. Most major news outlets in the United States report on daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 despite not normally reporting on mortality totals.  

The following work seeks to add perspective to the daily COVID-19 death totals by comparing them to overall mortality in the United States.  This work's findings provide insight into understanding death data, its pitfalls, and interesting trends, specifically about Influenza & Pneumonia, which may suggest how to view the current COVID-19 totals.

## Goals
This work seeks to answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li>How do the COVID-19 totals compare to overall United States mortality?</li>
<li>Is the overall United States death rate showing different behavior relative to prior years?</li>
<li>Is the Percentage of Deaths due to Influenza and Pneumonia diverging in 2020 vs. prior years?</li>
</ol>


## Background




## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Hypothesis Tests



## Conclusion


1. Look into overall Mortality in the context of a pandemic. Adds something to compare daily numbers and reports to since we are not used to seeing deaths reported daily
2. Adds insight into potential ramifications of statewide shutdowns and corresponding changes in behavior
3. Provides color into issues with reporting on deaths and COVID-19 (& pneumonia)  which helps to explain social discourse and confusion
4. Looks into prior Flu Seasons to put COVID-19 projections against them - both the projections with and without social distancing
